    <p>I was born a twin in Plano, Texas on December 23rd, 2003. I have been a christian ever since a I was young. A few years after my father died in a trajic accident, my family moved to Delaware. I am a quiet thinker, and I don't talk all that much around people I'm not familar with. I don't have many connects with others, which gave me a lot of freetime to think to myself. I've always loved stories, like the ones in t.v. shows, books, movies, comics, and videogames. No matter how I was feeling or what was happeining in my life I always had stories with me, so naturally they've become a big part of my life. Ever since I was about six years old, I have been crafting a story of my own to oneday share with the world to reach other people like me.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am seventeen years old and have recently become a licenced author through the self-publishing program with Barnes and Noble. I am very close to completeing my first book. I am also an artist and I make my own covers and art for my book. I plan to make a book series to entertain and arouse the thoughts of my readers. I am interested in coding because I want to learn how to make my own website to help acheive this goal.</p>

    <p>I am a creative thinker who can solve any problem I put my mind to. I don't like to leave things unfinished or do things halfway. I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to things I'm passionate about. I like to keep things neat and orderly. I'm also a very abstract thinker, and like to find unconventional solutions to problems. I often find myself going to my computer late at night to write down a random thought I had. My inspirations are pulled from a variety of places, like: Anime, games, books, anime, movies, t.v. shows, anime, music, comics, anime, manga, and surprisingly anime.</p>
